					Me and my sisters are twins, we started our lives as strays in the streets of Hong Kong. We are nearly authentic Chinese dingos, predecesors of the Austrailian dingos. We were adopted by the Pasin family and now we spend our days writing blogs!

				This morning my owners picked me up from the kennel. They had been on a trip in Colorado. I hate the kennel, the food id bland, the dogs rude and the caretakers unwilling to spend large amounts of time petting me.

			<p class="blogtext">Me and my sister really enjoy going on walks, but my sister is so shy that most of the time she rely on me to guide her around. We really love each other, as well as all our other family members as well. We are always really excited when our boy comes home and we love getting pet and playing with them both inside and outside. I hope that we can keep on having as much fun as we are now for the rest of the summer and our lives. Because we grew up in Hong Kong we are used to the heat and we are really happy about</p>
